abstract: Quinones are one of the most important redox-reactive organic compounds in natural environments, such as soil, water, and sediment, playing an important role in regulating the environmental processes and biogeochemical cycles of critical elements under climate change, including the influences of extreme events such as wildfires. However, to date, no existing methods can quantify quinones in complex environmental media. To overcome this challenge, a quantification method was developed by coupling chemical tagging of quinones by cysteine-containing nonaromatic peptides (Cpep) through a Michael addition reaction with size exclusionary chromatography (SEC) separation and ultraviolet (UV) analysis─leveraging on the characteristic absorbance of aromatic rings at 254 nm and molecular size of peptide. The method was demonstrated using model quinones, including 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), 1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ), and 1,4-anthraquinone (AQ), with a detection limit of 3.3, 0.7, and 0.2 μM, respectively. Concentrations of quinones in water extractions of biochars, soils, and wildfire-derived ashes were determined to range from 0.8 to 14 μM and were positively correlated with their redox reactivity determined by a chemical assay. This method provides a novel rapid quantification of quinones in complex environmental media as well as a quick assessment for redox reactivity and opens up new avenues for studying environmental transformation and remediation of contaminants.
