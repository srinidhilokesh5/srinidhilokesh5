    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I was born in Bangalore, India, and completed my Bachelor of Technology in mining engineering from the National Institute of Technology, Karnataka. Subsequently, I pursued a Master of Science degree in environmental engineering from New York University. During my time there, I worked with Dr. Andrea Silverman, an experience that marked my introduction to laboratory work. My fascination with environmental chemistry deepened as I grew to understand the gravity of ongoing environmental challenges. This led me to towards a Ph.D. in environmental engineering under the guidance of Dr. Yu (Frank) Yang at the University of Nevada, Reno. During a seminar I was introduced to Dr. Thomas Borch, whose impactful research at Colorado State University resonated with me. When a post-doctoral opportunity arose in his laboratory, I jumped on it.
