                My research pursuits have been centered around distinct themes. At the University of Nevada, Reno, I focused on exploring the efficacy of aqueous phase biochar for dehalogenating organic contaminants. Additionally, I delved into the behavior of a novel toxic compound, 6PPD-quinone, at the asphalt-water interface. During my doctoral studies, I developed a strong interest for high-resolution mass spectrometric analysis techniques. Using these techniques I worked on identifying ligands capable of binding with Fe derived from degraded lignin, as well as quinone-containing molecules in aqueous biochar.
        
        Upon transitioning to Colorado State University for my postdoctoral tenure, my current focus is investigating pollutants released from structural fires. My work involves employing both targeted and non-targeted high-resolution mass spectrometric analyses to identify and quantify these pollutants. This research seeks to shed light on the complex chemical landscape arising from such incidents.
